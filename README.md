# CS50 problem set week 5 - C
This repository shows my implementation of the related problem set.

During week 5 in CS50 the problem set given was to create a C console application for spell-checking texts against dictionaires.
The goal of week 5 was to understand data structures like linked lists, hash tables and tries f.e.

Given by the course was the main structure of the project. 
Implementing the methods for spell-checking in the dictionary.c file was up to the participant.
Feel free to explore my implementation. I'm open for any feedback.
